# Desktop Backgrounds

I like to take wildlife photos, and I use my own photos for my desktop background. Use as you please as long as you aren't making money (unless you give it all to me). 

The photos are organized by aspect ratio and then by resolution. Some folders may be empty, and I may make photos to fit those if I feel like it. I believe using a photo that is an integer multiple of your monitor resolution will still look as crisp as the same photo of the exact resolution, so I believe a 4k background could be used with standard HD. The "current-use" folder is where I copy the specfic photo or photos I want to use. You could also just take whichever ones you want and put them in some other folder.

Enjoy
