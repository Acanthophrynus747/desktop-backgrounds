# Desktop Backgrounds

I like to take wildlife photos, and I use my own photos for my desktop background. Use as you please as long as you aren't making money (without giving it all to me). 

The "all-backgrounds" folder contains all the photos in the collection that are formatted properly for a typical monitor (at least the one I use, 16:9). The "my-backgrounds" folder is where I copy the specfic photo or photos I want to use. You could also just take whichever ones you want and put them in some other folder.

Some of the photos are 4k, and some are just standard HD, depending on how much I had to crop in the image during editing. I may reorganize in the future with folders by resolution or screen dimensions. 

Enjoy
